# Data Analysis of Alcohol Consumption by Country

Final Project for Journalism 124 by Julia Dureault 

I found this data on the FiveThirtyEight Github Data Repository. The data is originally from the World Health Organization, Global Information System on Alcohol and Health  from 2010. The data was then adjusted by Mona Chalabi for her FiveThirtyEight Article, ['Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?'](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/). All of the data was originally represented in liters of pure alcohol. Chalabi took the average alcohol content and average serving size for each type of alcoholic beverage and converted that into how many servings of each type of beverage that would be equal to. Her edited data is what the following webpage will be using. 

Since the data was from FiveThirtyEight I was lucky enough that the .csv file was already represented in a chart. I then copied and pasted the chart into google sheets. I froze the first row and first column on my sheet so it would be easier to work with. To be able to add the .csv file to github I saved the raw .csv file to my desktop and then uploaded it to github. 

When looking at the data I first wanted to see what countries consumed the most alcohol. To find this information I sorted the column for total litres of pure alcohol from Z to A. The map below shows the total litres of pure alcohol consumed in 2010 by the average person in the country. Darker shades show higher levels of consumption. The ten countries that consume the most alcohol are Belarus, Lithuania, Andorra, Grenada, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Slovakia.

</script>

I then wanted to see what type of alcohol the top 10 countries consumed the most of. The chart below shows the number of servings of a specific alcoholic beverage the average person in these top 10 countries consumes in a year. The serving size would be one can of beer, one shot of spirit, and one glass of wine. 
 

<iframe title="What do countries with the highest alcohol consumption drink? (2010)" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XelXZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XelXZ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

What I found the most interesting about the data is that while countries who drink the most wine and spirits are in the top 10 countries for alcohol consumption, the country who drinks the most beer is not. Namibia drinks the most beer, with the average person having 376 servings of beer in a year, but is ranked 55 for total alcohol consumption. There were other countries who made the top 10 for consumption of a specific type of alcohol but did not make the top 10 of overall alcohol consumption. I also found it interesting that the US was not in the top 10 for any of the categories. The US was ranked 38 for total consumption of alcohol, 23 for beer consumption, 35 for spirit consumption, and 42 for wine consumption.  

In order to find this I organized each column individually from Z to A to see which country was the top for each category. I copied and pasted each column into a second chart so that I could compare the numbers. The chart below shows what countries consume the most beer, wine, and spirits. 

<iframe title="Which Countries Drink the Most Beer, Spirits, and Wine? (2010)" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-czAZl" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/czAZl/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="538"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

Unfortunately, this data is from 2010 so it will be interesting to see how the alcohol consumption has changed over the decade when the 2020 data is released.
