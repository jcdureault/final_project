# Data Analysis of Alcohol Consumption by Country

Final Project for Journalism 124 by Julia Dureault 

I found this data on the FiveThirtyEight Github Data Repository. The data is originally from the World Health Organisation, Global Information System on Alcohol and Health  from 2010. The data was then adjusted by Mona Chalabi for her FiveThirtyEight Article, ['Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?'](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/). The data was originally represented in liters of pure alcohol. Chalabi then took the average alcohol content and average serving size for each type oc alcoholic beverage and converted that into how many servings of each type of beverage that would be equal to. Her edited data is what the following webpage will be using. 

When looking at the data I first wanted to see what countries consumed the most alcohol. The map below shows the total litres of pure alcohol. Darker shades show higher levels of consumption. The ten countries that consume the most alcohol are Belarus, Lithuania, Andorra, Grenada, France, the Czech Republic, Russia, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Slovakia.   

<iframe title="Alcohol Consumption by Country" aria-label="map" id="datawrapper-chart-Q7plJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q7plJ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="334"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

I then wanted to see what type of alcohol the top 10 countries consumed the most of. The chart below shows the number of servings of a specific alcoholic beverage the average person in these top 10 countries consumes in a year. The serving size would be one can of beer, one shot of spirit, and one glass of wine. 
 

<iframe title="What do countries with the highest alcohol consumption drink?" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XelXZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XelXZ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

What I found the most interesting about the data is that while countries who drink the most wine and spirits are in the top 5 countries for alcohol consumption, the country who drinks the most beer is not. Namibia drinks the most beer, with the average personing having 376 servings of beer in a year, but is ranked 55 for total alcohol consumption. The chart below is an image taken from the [FiveThirtyEight Article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) and shows what countries consume the most beer, wine, and spirits.
